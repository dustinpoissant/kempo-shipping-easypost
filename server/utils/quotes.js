/*
  Turning the parcels kempo-shipping packed into carrier quotes. Pure apart from the client and cache it is given, so it is
  tested with a fake client.

  `ready` is whether the customer has finished entering the address (kempo-shipping says so). While it is false nothing is asked of
  the carrier, because every request can cost money; a price already in the cache is still used, and a parcel that needed a
  request is left unpriced and reported as `pending`, which the hook passes back so kempo-shipping waits instead of falling back.
  One EasyPost shipment prices a parcel with every carrier on the account, so a parcel costs one request however many
  services the seller offers, and the answer is kept per route, weight and size. A quote is added for each service the seller
  offers; kempo-shipping then offers the customer every carrier and service that has a quote for every parcel. A parcel that
  cannot be priced (no weight, too heavy, no ZIP code, not a US address) gets no quote from here, and the store's own table
  or the flat rate covers it.
